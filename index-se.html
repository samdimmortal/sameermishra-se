								<p>Dear Reader,</br></br> 
I am writing to introduce myself as a candidate for the roles under Human-Computer Interaction fields or Computer Science and Engineering. I graduated from Mumbai University in 2017 with a Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science and Engineering. After my graduation I have continued my studies at Uppsala University to obtain a Master’s Degree in Human-Computer Interaction. I am expecting to finish my degree in Human-Computer Interaction during January of 2021.
During my studies, I have been working at various smaller roles as a client-business representative towards various clients. Along with part time volunteer work during the semesters.</br></br> I am now looking for an opportunity to combine and develop my interest in information technology in an intellectual challenging environment. 
Through my experiences and academic background, I have acquired important skills in User Experience and IT, as well as in  analysis and innovation. In particular, my studies in HCI have provided me with a broad skill set within programming and databases along with understanding user mental models and products which creates a strong synergy with my earlier studies.</br></br> My previous works have given me valuable experience and insights of various industries. My tasks at the work have included assisting and leading various tasks. Brainstorm, develop ideas, make them a reality, analyse,evaluate and work the feedback. Dedication towards the whole project life cycle in solo or team roles. During my time at jobs, I have further developed my skills in collaboration been required to quickly adapt to new situations. </br></br>
With the competences that I have acquired through my background in business and IT related fields, I believe that I would make a good fit for the given position.
I am excited by the possibility to work for an innovative company as yours, and would welcome the opportunity to talk to you further about my experience, qualifications and interests as well as to hear about the opportunities as an employee.</br></br> I look forward to hear from you.</br></br> 
Yours sincerely,</br> Sameer Mishra
